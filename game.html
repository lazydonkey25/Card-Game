                <p id="rules">Rules: The goal of the game is to destroy the other players ship through whatever means
                    necessary. <br>There are three attack types: Kinetic, Energy, and Mixed and three health types:
                    Shield, Armor and Hull.Kinetic deals half damage to shields but double damage to armor. Energy is
                    the opposite dealing half damage to armor but double to shields. Mixed has no bonus against either
                    but no weaknesses either. Hull takes normal damage from all sources, and once you run out of hull
                    <em>you lose.</em><br> There are also support cards which give a variety of buffs but typically deal
                    no damage, use these to increase your odds of winning, but be careful for drawbacks.
